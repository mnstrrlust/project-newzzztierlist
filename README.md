VISUAL spreadsheet for the placements (might be outdated): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zulNYi4aizj1YUfWObWtmrN5-Swzw2SJ6rsHw8YuF5A

This is an "agent efficiency" tierlist, based on prydwen.gg, following (essentially) the same criteria, which you can find here:
https://www.prydwen.gg/zenless/tier-list

The difference being that I'll also consider general use, overall user opinion and using new tags, such as:

- Buff: Stun characters that buff the team in any way (Since all Support characters buff the team in some way, this tag is already "applied by default", therefore it's not shown to avoid redundance)
- Heal: Characters that heal/Affect HP positively
- Partner: Need specific teammates for full potential
- PEN: Characters that are related to the PEN effect in some way (might be removed in the future)
