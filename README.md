### Haven't settled on a name yet

This is an "agent performance" tierlist, based on prydwen.gg, following (essentially) the same criteria, which you can find here:
https://www.prydwen.gg/zenless/tier-list

The difference being that I'll also consider general use, overall user opinion and using new tags, such as:

- Buff: Stun characters that buff the team in any way (Since all Support characters buff the team in some way, this tag is already "applied by default", therefore it's not shown to avoid redundance)
- Partner: Need specific teammates for full potential
