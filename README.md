This is an "agent efficiency" tierlist, based on prydwen.gg, following (essentially) the same criteria, which you can find here:

https://www.prydwen.gg/zenless/tier-list

The difference being that I'll also consider general use, overall user opinion and using new tags, such as:

Buff: Stun characters that buff the team in any way (Since all Support characters buff the team in some way, this tag is already "applied by default", therefore it's not shown to avoid redundance)

HP: Characters that affect/are affected by HP (Includes healing)

Ult/Chain: characters that buff ultimates and/or chain attacks

Partner: Need specific teammates for full potential
